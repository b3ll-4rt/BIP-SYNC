# BIP-SYNC

A simple program to synchronize audio and video.

When you press Enter Key, the window will turn green and a sound will play, when you release the key, the window will turn red again and the sound will stop. This is useful for synchronizing audio and video, serving the same purpose as claps or clapperboards.

Don't expect much from this program, it's a basic tool I made to synchronize audio and video in OBS, maybe you'll find it useful too.
